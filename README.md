# Cryptogram
## An Ethereum DApp for supporting and popularizing digital content

### The DApp is hosted here: https://crygram-dapp.web.app

### The app allows to create profiles and link them to Ethereum addresses. Once registered, we can upload images, give them a title, description, price and a participation percentage. The Artworks can be supported, just clicking to the like button. This revalues the price and assigns a new microinversor. When somebody purchases the artwork, the funds are distributed among the creator and microinversors, according to the participation percentage. The first ones who supported the artworks get a higher percentage, in reward to the risk taken as wasting gas to write into Ethereum the operation when there was no information to predict whether the artwork would end to be successful.
